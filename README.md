**Selenium WebDriver Framework for SauceDemo**

**Overview**


This repository contains an automation testing framework built with Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber, and Java. The framework is designed to automate tests for the SauceDemo website. It provides a structured approach to writing and executing automated test scenarios using the behavior-driven development (BDD) methodology.

**Features**
**BDD Test Scenarios:** 
Write test scenarios in natural language using Gherkin syntax.
**Page Object Model (POM):** 
Implement a modular and maintainable testing framework using the POM design pattern.
**Cross-Browser Testing:** 
Execute tests across different web browsers by configuring WebDriver instances.
**Parallel Execution:** 
Run tests concurrently to reduce execution time.
**Reporting:** 
Generate detailed test reports using Cucumber's built-in reporting features.
